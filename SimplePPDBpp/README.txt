simpleppdbpp_xl.tsv :

This file consists of the lexical and phrasal paraphrase rules from the XL version of PPDB along with their readability
scores and PPDB 2.0 scores. Each line consists of a paraphrase rule, relative complexity score and PPDB 2.0 score
separated by tabs. The format of the file is:

<phrase1>   <phrase2>   <complexity score>    <PPDB score>

If relative complexity score is positive, then phrase1 is more complex than phrase2 and vice-versa.

We will release relative complexity scores for all other versions of PPDB - (S, M, L, XL, XXL, XXXL) soon.
